But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s smile dropping slightly.

"Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 54. Where are you getting all the sweet stuff? Who\u2019s your supplier?! HECTOR I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I thought we were all friends.

HECTOR (pointing to a truck) Honey Farms. It comes from Honey Farms. ANGLE ON: A Honey Farms truck leaving the parking lot. Barry turns, takes off after the truck through an alley.

MOOSEBLOOD Trouble? You\'re a mosquito. You\'re in trouble! Nobody likes us. They\u2019re just all smacking. People see a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY At least you\u2019re out in the world. You must meet a lot of girls. MOOSEBLOOD Mosquito girls try to trade up; get with a moth, dragonfly...mosquito girl don\u2019t want no mosquito. A BLOOD MOBILE pulls up alongside.

BARRY Remember what Van said. Why is your life any more valuable than mine? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 81. KEN It\u2019s funny, I just can\u2019t seem to recall that! Ken WHACKS at Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT\'D) I think something stinks in here. He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower, pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY Ken, look at me! I\u2019m wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. ANGLE ON: Ken turning the hand shower nozzle from \u201cGENTLE\u201d, to \u201cTURBO\u201d, to \u201cLETHAL\u201d.

The items from the vanity (emory board, lipstick, eye curler, etc.) are on the toilet seat. Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT\'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\u2019re bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\u2019s surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\u2019s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing? KEN You know what? I don\u2019t even like honey! I don\u2019t eat it! VANESSA We need to talk!

BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. (puts his hands in his pockets) I couldn\u2019t overcome it. Oh well.

COURTROOM - NEXT DAY ANGLE ON: Medium shot of Montgomery standing at his table. MONTGOMERY We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. ADAM (whispering to Vanessa) Now that\u2019s a good idea. (to Barry) You can really see why he\u2019s considered one of the very best lawyers-- Oh. Barry rolls his eyes. He gets up, takes the stand. A juror in a striped shirt APPLAUDS. MR. GAMMIL (whispering) Layton, you\u2019ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it\u2019s going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees\u201d. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don\u2019t worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don\u2019t like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT\u2019D) Mr. Benson Bee. I\u2019ll ask you what I think we\u2019d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We\u2019re friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes.

ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry\u2019s parents. MONTGOMERY You\u2019re an illegitimate bee, aren\u2019t you Benson? ADAM He\u2019s denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They\u2019re agitated.

JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - \u201cADAM AT HOSPITAL\u201d INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT\'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don\u2019t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it! That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I\u2019ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - \u201cSMOKING GUN\u201d INT.

ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who\u2019s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil\u2019s boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT\'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper\'s SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or Non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery\'s racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He\'s playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting "Free the bees". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a \u201chigh 5\u201d. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT\'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\u2019s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We\u2019ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - \u201cHONEY ROUNDUP\u201d EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we\u2019re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we\u2019re all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

BARRY Mmmm...you know, I\u2019m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn\u2019t think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it\u2019s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that\u2019s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh.

VANESSA I don\u2019t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry. BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

Barry and Vanessa take off in the float. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Let\u2019s see what this baby will do. ANGLE ON: Guy with headset talking to drivers. HEADSET GUY Hey! The float ZOOMS by. A young CHILD in the stands, TIMMY, cries. CUT TO: EXT. FLOAT STAGING AREA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER ANGLE ON: Vanessa putting the princess hat on. BARRY (V.O) Then all we do is blend in with traffic, without arousing suspicion. CUT TO: EXT. THE PARADE ROUTE - CONTINUOUS The floats go flying by the crowds. Barry and Vanessa\u2019s float CRASHES through the fence. CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 109. EXT. LA FREEWAY Vanessa and Barry speed, dodging and weaving, down the freeway. BARRY (V.O) And once we\u2019re at the airport, there\u2019s no stopping us. CUT TO: EXT. LAX AIRPORT Barry and Vanessa pull up to the curb, in front of an TSA AGENT WITH CLIPBOARD. TSA AGENT Stop. Security. Did you and your insect pack your own float? VANESSA (O.C) Yes. TSA AGENT Has this float been in your possession the entire time? VANESSA (O.C) Since the parade...yes. ANGLE ON: Barry holding his shoes. TSA AGENT Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets? Can you remove your stinger, Sir? BARRY That\u2019s part of me. TSA AGENT I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY Barry and Vanessa\u2019s airplane TAKES OFF. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 110. BARRY (O.C) Then, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll have just enough pollen to do the job. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 4025 - \u201cCOCKPIT FIGHT\u201d INT. AIRPLANE Vanessa is on the aisle. Barry is on a laptop calculating flowers, pollen, number of bees, airspeed, etc. He does a \u201cStomp\u201d dance on the keyboard. BARRY Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is going to work, Vanessa. VANESSA It\u2019s got to work. PILOT (V.O) Attention passengers. This is Captain Scott. I\u2019m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area. And looks like we\u2019re going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. VANESSA Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They\u2019ll never make it. BARRY I\u2019ve got to get up there and talk to these guys. VANESSA Be careful. Barry flies up to the cockpit door. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS A female flight attendant, ANGELA, is in the cockpit with the pilots. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 111. There\u2019s a KNOCK at the door.

PILOT (pulling an earphone back, to the co-pilot) What did you say, Hal? CO-PILOT I didn\u2019t say anything. PILOT (he sees Barry) Ahhh! Bee! BARRY No, no! Don\u2019t freak out! There\u2019s a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones) Ahhh! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 112. The pilot grabs a \u201cDUSTBUSTER\u201d vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT\'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilot\u2019s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I\u2019m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who\u2019s an attorney? PILOT Don\u2019t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot\u2019s nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button. The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold. Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN Vanessa studies her laptop, looking serious. SFX: PA CRACKLE. BARRY (V.O) (in captain voice) Good afternoon passengers, this is your captain speaking. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24F please report to the cockpit. And please hurry! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 113. ANGLE ON: The aisle, and Vanessa head popping up. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA What happened here? BARRY I tried to talk to them, but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded...Now one\u2019s bald, one\u2019s in a boat, and they\u2019re both unconscious. VANESSA Is that another bee joke? BARRY No. No one\u2019s flying the plane. The AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, BUD, speaks over the radio. BUD This is JFK control tower. Flight 356, what\u2019s your status? Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. I\u2019m a florist from New York. BUD Where\u2019s the pilot? VANESSA He\u2019s unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience? A BEAT. BARRY As a matter of fact, there is. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 114. BUD Who\u2019s that? VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It\u2019s got giant wings, huge engines. VANESSA I can\u2019t fly a plane. BARRY Why not? Isn\u2019t John Travolta a pilot? VANESSA Yes? BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we\u2019re headed into some lightning. CUT TO: Vanessa shrugs, and takes the controls. SEQ. 4150 - \u201cBARRY FLIES PLANE\u201d INT. BENSON HOUSE The family is all huddled around the TV at the Benson house. ANGLE ON: TV. Bob Bumble is broadcasting. BOB BUMBLE This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK airport, where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory... "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 115. Adam SPRAYS a can of HONEY-WHIP into his mouth. ADAM That\u2019s Barry. BOB BUMBLE ...is now attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers, and an incapacitated flight crew. EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there\u2019s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I\u2019m quite familiar with Mr. Benson\u2019s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven\u2019t they done enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn\u2019t he your only hope right now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn\u2019t be able to fly at all. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are too big-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold on a second. Haven\u2019t we heard this million times? The surface area of the wings, and the body mass doesn\u2019t make sense? JEANETTE CHUNG Get this on the air. CAMERAMAN You got it! CUT TO: INT. BEE TV CONTROL ROOM An engineer throws a switch. BEE ENGINEER Stand by. We\u2019re going live. The \u201cON AIR\u201d sign illuminates. CUT TO: INT. VARIOUS SHOTS OF NEW HIVE CITY The news report plays on TV. The pollen jocks are sitting around, playing paddle-ball, Wheel-o, and one of them is spinning his helmet on his finger. Buzzwell is in an office cubicle, playing computer solitaire. Barry\u2019s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\u2019s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That\u2019s the bee way. We\u2019re not made of Jello. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. CROWD OF BEES Hello! CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Barry is giving orders to Vanessa. BARRY Left, right, down, hover. VANESSA Hover? BARRY Forget hover. VANESSA You know what? This isn\u2019t so hard. Vanessa pretends to HONK THE HORN. VANESSA (CONT\u2019D) Beep, beep! Beep, beep! A BOLT OF LIGHTNING HITS the plane. The plane takes a sharp dip. VANESSA (CONT\u2019D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we\u2019re not! VANESSA (V.O.)

This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We\u2019re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we\u2019re going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say?
